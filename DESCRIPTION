Description: Network Common Data Form (NetCDF) files are widely used for 
    scientific data. Library-level access in R is provided through packages 
    'RNetCDF' and 'ncdf4'. Package 'ncdfCF' is built on top of 'RNetCDF' and 
    makes the data and its attributes available as a set of S4 classes that are 
    informed by the Climate and Forecasting Metadata Conventions. Access to the 
    data uses standard R subsetting operators and common function forms.
